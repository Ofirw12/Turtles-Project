# Turtles-Project
This is a Java project that demonstrates the use of inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces in creating a turtle army that can be controlled by the user. The project consists of three separate assignments, each building on the previous one to create a fully-functional turtle army.

# Assignment 1: TwoTurtles
In the first assignment, you are required to write a TwoTurtles.java file that uses the turtle.jar file to create two turtles named Java and Python. You will then use these turtles to draw a laptop on the screen.

# Assignment 2: Different Types of Turtles
The second assignment was to create several different types of turtles that inherit from the base Turtle class. These include a simple Turtle, IntelligentTurtle, DrunkTurtle, JumpyTurtle, LazyTurtle, and BurmeseTurtle. Each of these turtles has its unique characteristics and behaviors that are determined by overriding the methods inherited from the base Turtle class.

# Assignment 3: Managing a Turtle Army with Polymorphism
The third and final assignment was to manage a turtle army using polymorphism. The Army class allows the user to select the types of turtles they want in their army from a menu of options. Once the turtles are selected, they perform a series of actions together, such as walking in a straight line, turning, and drawing a hexagon. Each turtle performs these actions in the order in which they were selected by the user.
